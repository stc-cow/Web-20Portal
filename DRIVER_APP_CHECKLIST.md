## 🚀 Next Steps (Manual Setup Required)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/preferences @capacitor/camera @capacitor/filesystem
npm install @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios --save-dev
```

### 2. Initialize Capacitor (if not already done)

```bash
npx cap init
```

### 3. Build and Sync

```bash
npm run build:client
npx cap sync
```

### 4. Configure Supabase Database

Run the SQL scripts from `DRIVER_APP_SETUP.md` to create tables:

- drivers
- driver_tasks
- driver_task_entries
- driver_notifications
- driver_push_tokens

### 5. Set Environment Variables

Update your `.env` file with:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-key>
FCM_SENDER_ID=874270110177
FCM_SERVER_KEY=ceUStHy-_lvdizGfxYtaHhhJWzh5RovRwOxeir8L6z4
VITE_PUSH_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true
```

### 6. Add Capacitor Plugins (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
npm install @capacitor/camera @capacitor/filesystem
npx cap sync
```

### 7. Build for Android

```bash
npx cap sync android
npx cap open android
# Build and run in Android Studio
```

### 8. Build for iOS (Mac only)

```bash
npx cap sync ios
npx cap open ios
# Build and run in Xcode
```

### 9. Test Web Version

```bash
npm run dev
# Navigate to http://localhost:5173/#/driver/login
```
