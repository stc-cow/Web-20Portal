## 🧪 Pre-Deployment Testing

### Web Testing (Local)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/preferences

# 2. Run development server
npm run dev

# 3. Test driver login
# Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/#/driver/login

# Test Cases:
[ ] Enter invalid credentials - shows error
[ ] Enter valid credentials - redirects to dashboard
[ ] Check localStorage for session on page reload
[ ] Verify dashboard loads with task list
[ ] Filter tasks by status
[ ] Search tasks
[ ] Click "View Details" - navigate to mission detail
[ ] Fill fuel entry form
[ ] Submit form
[ ] View notifications
[ ] Change password
[ ] Click logout - redirect to login

[ ] Verify sidebar menu styling
  - Navy blue background
  - Red active border
  - Capitalize text
  - No icons (text only)

[ ] Verify dashboard modernization
  - Donut charts instead of pie
  - Center labels ("Fuel Distribution", "Diesel %")
  - Names and percentage only (no quantity)
  - Updated colors
  - Rounded cards with light background
```

### Build Testing

```bash
# Build client
npm run build:client

# Check build output
ls -la dist/spa/

# Expected output size: < 5MB for production
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Run TypeScript check
npm run typecheck

# Should complete with no errors
```

---

## 📋 Deployment Workflow

### Step 1: Verify Code Quality

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run typecheck

# Format code (optional)
npm run format.fix

# Check for any linting issues
# (if eslint configured)
```

### Step 2: Build for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Verify build succeeded
echo $?  # Should output 0 for success
```

### Step 3: Create Git Commit

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Create commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: implement complete driver app with auth, realtime sync, and push notifications

- Add Supabase authentication with session persistence
- Implement driver dashboard with mission list
- Create fuel entry form with image upload
- Add notifications system
- Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging integration
- Add settings and profile management
- Update sidebar UI with ACES branding
- Modernize dashboard with donut charts
- Add comprehensive documentation"
```

### Step 4: Push to Driver_App Branch

```bash
# Ensure you're on the correct branch
git branch

# If not on Driver_App, switch to it
git checkout Driver_App

# Push changes
git push origin Driver_App

# Verify push
git log --oneline | head -5
```

### Step 5: Create Pull Request (Optional)

```bash
# Create PR on GitHub for code review
# Base: main
# Compare: Driver_App
```
